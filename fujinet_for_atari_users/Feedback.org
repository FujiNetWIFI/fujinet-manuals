DONE 1. It might be worth mentioning that the Fujinet plugs into the SIO port and is compatible with (nearly?) all Atari computers.
DONE 2. "TNFS" is mentioned, but not described, on page 1. It may be worth explaining what TNFS is.
3. I can't make sense of Figure I-1, despite being familiar with how disk images and virtual drive slots work on Fujinet.
4. It took me a while to figure out what the second item in Figure I.2 is. (It's a Fujinet, but that was totally not obvious at first). There's also a penultimate step, which is to access the file from the Fujinet on a PC before finally sending it to a printer.
DONE 5. In Figure I-3, the arrows between each item should be double-ended, since the Fujinet supports sending as well as receiving data over the WWW.
6. Figure I-4 looks a little confusing to me as well. I think it's missing a Fujinet running CP/M, between the SD card and the TV.
DONE 7. For Apetime, it might be worthwhile giving a mention to SpartaDOS X, and any Atari OSes besides SpartaDOS X that can make use of it.
